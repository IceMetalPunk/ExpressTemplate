Three-step process for setting up a workspace and template for a new SSL-secured, Heroku-based Express app in Node:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone the fork to your local machine
3. Run `node initFork.js` to install NPM packages, setup local SSL certs, and clean the .gitignore list

You can of course delete `initFork.js` when you're done setting up, if you want.
